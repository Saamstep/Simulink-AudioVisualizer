This project is a real-time Audio Visualizer built in Simulink, designed to process and visualize audio signals from a multimedia file. It converts the input to a mono signal, performs signal analysis, and displays frequency-domain information.

It uses a Simulink Stateflow diagram to control which input to use and if the output speaker should be driven or not.
